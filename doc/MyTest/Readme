Create a ruby extension in c

http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-create-a-ruby-extension-in-c-in-under-5-minutes-100.html

You create two files, extconf.rb, and MyTest.c, then you do:
- ruby extconf.rb
- make

This creates more files like mytest.so and MyTest.o

You can checkout now with the following simple runner:

require './mytest' # from the directory with the files
include MyTest
puts test1 # this line will then print 10
